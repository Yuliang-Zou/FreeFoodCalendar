Seeking Student Facilitators for Fall 2016 Michigan Engineering Common Reading Experience The Engineering Honors & Engagement office is hosting the Michigan Engineering Common Reading Experience for its fourth consecutive year. We are looking for a multitude of student volunteers to facilitate Common Reading Experience discussions with first-year engineers in September 2016. Students who volunteer to facilitate one or two discussion sessions will receive a free copy of the book, a t-shirt, and free facilitator training. No previous facilitation experience required! We are looking for volunteers who want to help build community and welcome incoming first-year engineers at one of their first on-campus events at Michigan. This year, all incoming Michigan Engineering freshmen will be reading the book Spare Parts by Joshua Davis over the summer.   http://commonread.engin.umich.edu/ Facilitation training will take place at the beginning of the fall semester. If you are interested in facilitating, please complete this form:  https://goo.gl/VSqW46 Please complete the form by April 19th. You can also visit the Honors & Engagement Office in 251 Chrysler to pick up your book.    If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to us at engin-cre@umich.edu.
