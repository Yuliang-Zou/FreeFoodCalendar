Extreme Time Think you know all about time? What about things that happen in femtoseconds or eons? Time in the natural world is so extreme, you can’t even perceive most of its scale unaided. You’ll be amazed by the types of time you can explore in our new exhibit, and learn more about everyday time and how we measure it, too! The exhibit opening reception on Friday, February 12 from 5:00-6:30 pm is open to the public.
