â€‹BE A LEADER Looking to be a mentor and build your leadership capacities? University Housing in partnership with Student Life is looking to select enthusiastic and resourceful students as Building Leaders to assist with the newly established MLEAD Academy (formerly known as the Move-In Maker Program). We will be looking for a balance of academic year, areas of study, and cultural diversity. Building Leaders for MLEAD Academy will be able to move back into University Housing early as well as receive free meals and compensation in the form of Blue Bucks.
