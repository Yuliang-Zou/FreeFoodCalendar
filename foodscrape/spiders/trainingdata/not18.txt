Hey Northwood! SHIRTS ARE IN!  You can pick up your FREE shirt during the business hours at the 2150 Cram Place CC (9am-12am Mon-Fri and 12pm-12am on Sun-Sat). There are no extras for those who didn't order already, and each person must pick up their own shirts (no picking up for friends/roommates).  Last day to pick up your shirt is April 19th!
