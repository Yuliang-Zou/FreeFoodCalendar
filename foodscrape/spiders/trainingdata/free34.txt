Saturday Morning Physics Why I’m Talking Less… and Other Strategies for Promoting Learning in the STEM Classroom / Anne McNeil, Arthur F. Thurnau Associate Professor of Chemistry (U-M) Research in education has converged on a number of effective strategies for engaging students and promoting learning. Leveraging these tools effectively is challenging because it requires a major overhaul of our existing courses and instructional strategies. Professor Anne McNeil will talk about efforts underway at U-M toward building better STEM courses by incorporating these new learning strategies, focusing on her own experiences while piloting a new chemistry laboratory course. All talks are free and refreshments will be served. Visitor parking (Central Campus) is across the street from Weiser Hall (formerly Dennison Building) in U-M Church Street parking structure. There is a $2.00 cash parking charge.
