Hello MPowered-ians, First off, hats off to Makeathon for killing it this past weekend! TL;DR 300 participants, over 90 boxes of pizzas and an awesome event! Reminders: IgniteIt Weekend website is live! Share that on your timeline please and thank you. SHS submissions closed this weekend! Reminder that they are bringing the finalists to campus Saturday, February 13th and we would love to see all of your beautiful faces for support. Feel free to reach out to Cyrus, here is his email: cyrustetteh@gmail.com Finally, if you have any questions, concerns, or comments about MPowered or just life in general (it can be totally casual) feel free to reach out to Exec. Promise we don't bite.  Cheers Exec
