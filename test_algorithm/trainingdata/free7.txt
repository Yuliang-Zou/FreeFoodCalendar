Hey Northwood!! Do you like free drinks and food? Do you like karaoke? Of course you do!! Which is great, because we are having a St. Patrick's Day event! Come to the Community Center on Friday, March 18 from 8-10 for karaoke, pizza, and mocktails! If you plan on attending, please fill out this Google form. Hope to see you there!
