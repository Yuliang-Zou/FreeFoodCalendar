Dear University of Michigan Faculty, Staff and Students, The 34th annual Blood Battle is underway! The remaining drives will run until November 25th. Whether you have never donated before or donate every year, we need your help! Over the past 33 years, the University of Michigan has collected enough blood to potentially save over 637,000 lives, and none of this would have been possible without the donors. Please make an appointment to donate on the American Red Cross website, www.redcrossblood.org, using the sponsor code "goblue" to view all of the drives in the Ann Arbor area. The American Red Cross will give all presenting donors a free Blood Battle t-shirt, a coupon for 'buy one, get one free' milkshakes from Pizza House, a discount food coupon for Ahmo's Mediterranean Grill, and a coupon for a free bagel with cream cheese with the purchase of a beverage from Bruegger's Bagels. While supplies last, all donors will also have the chance to win an electric bike from GenZe. For your convenience, the dates, times, and locations of this year's drives are listed below. Asterisks (*) indicate residence hall drives which are restricted to those who have MCard access during meal times. Please eat iron rich foods and drink plenty of water before you donate blood so that you are healthy on the day of your donation. Thank you once again for giving the gift of life. Keep bleeding maize and blue! #BleedMaizeandBlue #BeOurHeroHarbaugh #BloodBattle @BloodBattleUofM Sincerely, E. Royster Harper Vice President for Student Life
