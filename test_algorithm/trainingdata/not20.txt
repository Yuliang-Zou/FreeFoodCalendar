U-M junior Florence Rivkin (center) had little idea when she headed to Cuba in January what historic adventures awaited her during her semester abroad. Not only has she witnessed President Obama's visit to Havana last month, but she attended the free Rolling Stones concert - the first international rock concert since the 1959 revolution. But what Rivkin has enjoyed most about studying at the University of Havana is the friendships she has formed with her fellow Cuban students. That, and playing on the university's softball team, learning to salsa dance, and being forced to take a break from the Internet as Cuba still has little cyber service. "I feel truly lucky that I have been able to live in Cuba during such a transformative time," she writes in a blog from Havana.
