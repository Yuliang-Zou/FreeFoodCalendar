Engineers,In case you haven't heard, the Center for Entrepreneurship is having a lunch and learn session with the patent office. In addition to free lunch from Jerusalem Garden, you'll have the opportunity to learn about the patent process and careers in intellectual property, a hot area for engineers from every discipline. We're about to get started. Lunch starts in a few minutes at 11:30am at 1180 Duderstadt. Come on by. Looking forward to seeing you there! Best, Ashleigh
