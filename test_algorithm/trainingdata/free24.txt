Hey club members!  We've got quite a few exciting events this week, and a meeting next Monday Oct. 26th that you DON'T want to miss. It's after exam week, so what better way to spend your time than doing game development!  This weekend there's a Clash of Clans event where I'll be guest speaking. There's free food and swag there, so check out the attached flier for more info. Also, a friend of mine is recruiting for a job position with WebGL or 3D Graphics knowledge for a simulation web app. If that interests you, there is info below as well!
