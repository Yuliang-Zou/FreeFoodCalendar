My fellow Wolverines, I hope this message finds you well in body, spirit, and mind. As I reflect back on my time at the University of Michigan, one thing that I regret deeply is my limited interaction with the City of Detroit. As many of you are well aware, Detroit is not only a city with immense cultural, academic, and historical significance, but also the original site of the University of Michigan. As we transition into our third century of academic excellence and achievement in 2017, it is vital that we strengthen and affirm our deep connection to the City of Detroit. Since September 2013, the MDetroit Center Connector (Detroit Connector) has offered Michigan students and faculty free, reliable, transportation between Ann Arbor and Detroit, whether they are heading home for a long weekend, attending a concert or sporting event, or exploring any of Detroit's renowned cultural and academic centers. Unfortunately, at the end of this academic year there is potential that the Detroit Connector service will not be renewed. As a result, CSG would like to gather information about student usage of the Detroit Connector to advocate to the Office of the Provost and the Office of the President to renew the contract for the 2017 school year, and to develop a long term transit solution for UM students between the City of Detroit and the UM campus. Please complete the following survey about if and how you access the City of Detroit: https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1fmv89aTaXbhZQ1_1Pla5QhniPQJ1HYDvfpbcA9XUUG4/edit?usp=sharing_eid&ts=56f468c5 Students who fill out the survey will be entered to win a $50 blue bucks gift card. There will be multiple winners. Thank you and Go Blue!
