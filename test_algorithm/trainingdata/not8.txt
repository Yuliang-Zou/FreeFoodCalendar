PISE Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Workshop Saturday, March 28, 2015 1:00-4:00pm in 107 GFL Prof. Steve Skerlos from the Program in Sustainable Engineering will be hosting a Life Cycle Assessment workshop on Saturday, March 28th from 1 to 4pm in 107 GFL. Some of you may have encountered LCAs in CEE 265 or ME 499, but this workshop will dive deeper into the subject and provide you with the tools to apply LCA to a wide range of materials and situations. Prof. Skerlos will introduce two software tools for conducting LCAs and we will work with computers on hands-on examples. Conducting LCAs is a great skill to have on a resume and is sure to come in handy for those of you hoping to pursue careers in sustainable engineering! RSVPs are required at this link. Lunch will be provided! Feel free to reach out to sustainable.engineering@umich.edu for more info.
