DIG IN WITH UMS: UGLY SWEATER PARTY & HANDEL'S MESSIAH â€“ 12/6 Start the holiday season off right with some cookie decorating, holiday trivia, live music, dancing, and a truly heinous sweater. Pizza will be served, and fun prizes will be awarded. Your Ugly Sweater Party ticket includes a seat at the UMS Choral Union and Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra's performance of Handel's Messiah, one of the great holiday traditions on the U-M campus. If you think you've somehow managed to exist on this planet without hearing Handel's Messiah, watch this silly food court flash mob. You'll probably recognize the music: http://bit.ly/1bqgfwt Buy tickets to this awesome student hang-out (and the concert at Hill) at http://bit.ly/1AolnyD  NOTE: Student tickets are also available for a second performance of Messiah on Sunday, December 7 at 2 pm (but you're on your own for ugly sweaters and pizza!).
