Security Capture the Flag Sat. April 2, 12 - 7 PM @ 1109 FXB Michigan Hackers is proud to announce that we will be co-hosting an introductory Security Capture the Flag event with Facebook. Join us for seven hours of security, free food and prizes. What is a CTF? We will host a variety of vulnerable software, including crypto software, web applications, exploitable binaries, packet capture dumps containing passwords. Within each of these, will have hidden a 'flag'. Based on difficulty, different flags will be worth a different amount of points. Your goal to acquire as many points as you can, by exploiting these vulnerable pieces of software.
